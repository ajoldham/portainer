Portainer Docker Compose
========================

Portainer is a useful graphical utility to visualize a Docker environment.

To download the Docker Compose file do:

```php
git clone https://github.com/ajoldham/portainer
```

Run with:
```php
cd portainer
docker-compose up -d
```

this will download a pre-built image from Docker Hub and also start Portainer automatically when Docker is loaded.
